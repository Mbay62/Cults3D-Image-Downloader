# Cults3D Image Downloader

Cults3D images rarely load properly, this tool will provide direct links to the original image files and optionally download them all to a new folder.

Uses Python 3 and requires the 'requests' library to be installed (`pip install requests`).

To use, simply run the program (`python CultsImageDownloader.py`) and enter the URL of the model (or supply the link directly as a command-line argument, e.g `python CultsImageDownloader.py https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/cat-and-robot-from-the-game-stray-figurine`)
