# Cults3D Image Downloader

Cults3D images rarely load properly, this tool will provide direct links to the original image files and optionally download them all.

Uses Python 3 and requires the 'requests' library to be installed (pip install requests).

To use, simply run the program and enter the URL of the model (or supply the link directly as a command-line argument)
